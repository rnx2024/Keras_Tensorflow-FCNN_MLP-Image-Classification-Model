# Keras_Tensorflow-FCNN-MLP-Image-Classification-Model

This is a Google Colab Notebook for training a Keras Image Classification Model with Tensorflow. I used a pre-built dataset. Accuracy reached is almost 98%. 

The MNIST dataset was used. The MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 handwritten digit images, where each image represents a single digit from 0 to 9. The dataset is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image in the dataset is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.
